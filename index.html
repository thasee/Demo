    <p>Vanilla is the most popular ice cream all over the world.</p>

       <br> Vanilla can have a mild, floral quality; a sweet, almost-caramelized flavor that's reminiscent of marshmallows or toasted sugar, or a heady, almost-boozy quality similar to butterscotch.

    <p>The scent of vanilla has strong aroma-therapeutic properties.
        <br>
     In fact, its aromatics have been proven to be so potent that some medical institutions, including the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
      have used it to calm patients experiencing high levels of anxiety prior to a test or procedure. The calming aromatics of the scent have also been used to help people who suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. The fact that Vanilla has the propensity to induce such calm in people is a big factor that contributes to its overall appeal.
